Please help generate an appropriate response to answer the question.\n\nI will give you an example multi-turn dialog, where each turn contains a question and the corresponding response.\n\n# An Example Multi-turn Dialog:\n\nQuestion: What should I consider when buying a phone?\nResponse: The design of the phone and the overall look and feel of the phone are very important. You should be comfortable with the way the phone looks and feels when you hold it in your hand. In addition, don't be afraid to get a phone from a different manufacturer than you're used to. Consider an older, used, or refurbished phone to save money. Sometimes a year-old or even a two-year-old device might give you everything you need.\n\nQuestion: Cool. Which one would you recommend?\nResponse: If you want something more affordable, cheaper, but has the latest in Android and that comes with 5000mAh of battery, then the Motorola Moto G7 Power is an excellent phone to consider. If you want an Android smartphone that's cheaper, more affordable, and you still find the Moto G7 Power a bit off your budget, then I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy A10e.\n\nQuestion: Tell me more about the first one.\nResponse: It sports an 8-megapixel camera on the front for selfies with an f/2.2 aperture and a pixel size of 1.12-micron. Motorola Moto G7 Power is based on Android 9.0 and packs 32GB of inbuilt storage that can be expanded via a microSD card (up to 512GB). The Motorola Moto G7 Power is a dual-SIM (GSM and GSM) smartphone that accepts Nano-SIM and Nano-SIM cards. The Motorola Moto G7 Power measures 160.83 x 76.00 x 9.40mm (height x width x thickness) and weighs 198.00 grams.\n\nQuestion: How much cheaper is the A10e?\nResponse: The current lowest price found for Samsung Galaxy A10e is 7,499 and for Motorola Moto G7 is 13990. The details of both of these products were last updated on Jun 02, 2021.\n\nQuestion: Wow, that's almost half the cost! Can you compare them?\nResponse: For the past few years, Motorola's G-series has consistently ranked as a favourite budget phone among users and the G7 continues this legacy as an exceptional phone for its price. All in all, people still love the Moto G7. It's a fantastic, affordable phone, and it won awards for its inexpensive price, good camera and reliable performance. But the Galaxy A50 is better, even if it's a bit more expensive. \n\n# Now, you should give me the response of the **Current Question** for the following dialog.
